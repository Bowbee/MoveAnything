### PLEASE READ: I AM NOT THE MAINTAINER OF MOVEANYTHING ADDON

I am not able to fix anything currently, as the author Resike appears to still be active. The addon is covered by an All Rights Reserved license, so ive only fixed the constant and reoccuring LUA errors for my personal UI.

Resike's patreon states MoveAnything updates are planned.

All Issue requests will be cataloged in the case that Resike does not update the addon for Dragonflight and an appropriate alternative is not found. I will attempt to fix any recurring LUA errors before DragonFlight release without any functional additions. 

You are welcome to make a PR to fix any LUA errors, however please respect the original license of the MoveAnything addon.

I will not be publishing this fork to Curseforge. Lawyers are scary.
